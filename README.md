# TP Java - Exercises

## Description
This university project includes 12 practical Java exercises covering fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, attributes, methods, constructors, and encapsulation. The objective is to strengthen Java programming skills through real-world problem-solving scenarios.

## Features

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Class and Object Concepts**: Explanation and practical example.
- **Product Management System**: Create, modify, and display product information.
- **Encapsulation**: Implementation of getters and setters.
- **Constructors**: Simplifying object creation with predefined values.

### Java Application Development
- **Bank Account Management**: Deposit, withdraw, and calculate interest.
- **Geometric Shapes**: Calculating area and volume using Java methods.
- **Testing Classes**: Implementing a main method for verification.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Java
- **Libraries**: Scanner (for user input), Math (for mathematical calculations)
- **Concepts**: Classes, objects, methods, attributes, constructors, encapsulation
